As species recognition from audio improves rapidly (e.g. for birds, bats), can we think about distinguishing individuals within a species from their calls? Noting that (a) voice recognition in humans is well-understood (from 'voiceprint' vectors), and (b) many species are observed to recognise individuals from their calls (therefore the signal processing is possible). A potential application of such a capability might be counting of individuals within a local population (e.g. at small scale for use in forest canopy, or even at larger scale e.g. night-time migration, combined with supervised learning and probabilistic counting methods)."

Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can sense sound in real time along the dense network of fibre-optic telecommunication cables that cover both deep ocean and coastal areas around the globe. It can enable audio recognition of cetaceans, seals and human activities (vessel traffic, deep-sea mining etc.) even in the most remote oceanic areas. Seamounts rising to a few hundred meters below the sea surface are known to promote biological productivity of the ocean. Audio recognition of vocal species using optical fiber cables and DAS may be the only realistic way of monitoring these remote oceanic oases of productivity. The network of optical fiber cables for telecommunication makes it possible to upscale the distribution of audio recorders.  "

Conservation decisions are ideally based on the synthesis of the best available evidence.  Yet, most evidence syntheses done in the conservation space are static and fail to incorporate new evidence as it is generated (i.e., published).

Doing so will ensure decision makers have access to the best available evidence to guide them.

AI to accelerate and improve evidence synthesis in conservation

Evidence syntheses for biodiversity conservation are key for effective decision-making, yet are challenged by increasingly time-consuming tasks, a broad evidence base, and persistent underfunding. Large language models can accelerate evidence synthesis, and thus support efficient management of the biodiversity crisis, while making these exercises more timely, equitable and inclusive in terms of the evidence base considered.

4,Issue 4,Reviewing Literature,Multilingual literature scanning,"Multilingual literature scanning. There are various distinct applications (e.g. species monitoring, ecosystem health monitoring, research tracking) that can benefit from recent NLP advances. These advances include Large Language Models (LLM) and their fine tuning on specified data corpora; topic models and topic specification; machine translation. Note that geographic regions important for conservation are often not English-language-speaking, and important information may be produced in local languages. Migrating species such as birds may have populations spanning many language usages. So it's desirable to take advantage of data across non-English sources, coupled with AI translation capabilities. The output of this could be a database (or databases) linking species, geo-locations, human activities etc that can be used to enrich or support specific conservation activities and analyses."

10,Issue 10,Images,Detection of new species,"AI to detect new species

Existing AI systems are trained to identify specific species from images collected by sensors such as camera traps. But AI workflows have recently been developed for the detection and confirmation of unknown species status, providing a new solution, for example, for the acceleration of the documentation of ‘dark diversity’. The workflow can be coupled with a motion-activated, solar-powered machine equipped with a camera and a small computer, providing opportunities to collect information in biodiversity hotspots for months at a time. The approach could also be a game changer in terms of tracking how biodiversity is reshuffling with climate change.

Commercial fisheries cause bycatch of seabird species that is driving some species of albatrosses and large petrels towards extinction.

However, detecting compliance relies on boat-based observers, which is resource intensive. AI-enabled on-board camera systems could record seabird presence, interactions with fishing gear (e.g. cable strikes), bycatch (i.e. ensnared birds) and use of mitigation measures (compliance), enabling safer, cheaper and more reliable monitoring of compliance."

With the economies of scale of EOFM, we expect to see an abundance of new models that are able to estimate biodiversity loss or restoration directly from imagery, especially where we have extant training datasets such as PREDICTS, LPI, and others."

Building foundation models from remote sensing data will open up many new possibilities, because foundation models leverage large amounts of unlabelled data through self-supervised learning techniques. Key advantages include fusing multiple data modalities such as optical and radar imagery;  fine-tuning foundation models on smaller labelled datasets for various downstream tasks; global coverage that improve generalization across different geographic regions; enabling much smarter analyses of time-series dataset that are needed to track change.  In addition, remote sensing data often requires considerable “cleaning” before use,  e.g. because clouds obscure parts of the image or light conditions vary.  AI techniques could significantly enhance radiative transfer modelling in remote sensing enabling better generalisation for accurate canopy property retrievals."

ECRs will put their time into learning AI skills rather than engaging with the messy reality of field work meaning fewer and fewer people in the field. This could have a range of consequences e.g.: 1) Careers in conservation science become less attractive (and less realistic-selection will be on AI skills not field skills) for certain types of people-we end up selecting into conservation only those attracted by this sort of work meaning insights which come from ‘field people’ are lost. 2) Fewer people in the field means fewer new insights which come from field observation.  3) People engage with people (not AI), fewer ecology/conservation researchers doing things in the field e.g. around important sites for biodiversity, may mean fewer opportunities to touch/inspire local people about the value of that habitat/species."

This suggestion addresses the general problem of predicting outcomes (and long-term success or not) of conservation interventions. While AI methods such as reinforcement learning are being explored there is currently a lack of rigour in their use in biology. A 'digital twin' is a system model which is coupled to, and learns from, actual data generated by the physical system. Digital twins are well understood and used in engineering, and are also starting to be used in earth sciences (e.g. oceanography). The proposal here is to explore and establish digital twins as a tool for ecosystem modelling and prediction. A key opportunity would be the peering of digital twins across multiple domains of expertise (e.g. ocean physics, fish populations, seabird ecology). Digital twins could provide a trusted platform for more rigorous development of AI methods for intervention modelling.

17,Issue 17,Modelling,Improving species distribution models and species range estimation,"Species distribution models:  SDMs can be important for conservation decision makers, e.g. assessing the impacts of land use change on biodiversity.  Based on species occurrence records or presence/absence records,  SDMs produce maps of the (relative) probability of occurrences using large datasets obtained from remote sensing and other sources. AI methods like machine learning are well-suited to integrate and process these heterogeneous datasets efficiently, handling missing data, noise, and non-linear relationships between predictors and species occurrence probability; they can automatically learn relevant features directly from raw spatial data and uncover complex patterns and interactions.  However, we are currently limited by the small amount of labelled data available to train models (especially in the case of plant species and non-vertebrate animals!), spatial biases in data collection,  temporal mismatches between field datasets and remote sensing layers  and challenges with assessing accuracy and avoiding overfitting. How can new AI approaches (e.g. physics-inspired AI and xAI) + new citizen science datasets address these problems?

These models are valuable for modelling the impacts of climate change on nature in a human-dominated world (and visa versa).  However they have a serious believability problem:  predictions of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models do not align well with field measurements (e.g. of fluxes of greenhouse gas);  they fail to make reliable predictions of large-scales fires and drought-induced mortality even though large-scale disturbance events have profound effects on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity;  and they rarely include plant-animal interactions (the Madingley model being an exception!).	Many processes in the DGVMs are represented by semi-empirical semi-theoretical equations with parameters that need to be calibrated against observations. AI optimisation techniques could automate this calibration process, finding optimal parameter values that best fit the data across multiple scales.  Physics-inspired AI is another avenue worth pursuing. AI techniques such as reduced-order modelling could potentially find low-dimensional representations that capture the essential dynamics while being much faster to compute."

Most of the AI applications to conservation that I visualize involve some sort of central integration of tools and facilities, but there is also the option to look at the problem in a bottom-up way, by imagining an adaptable toolkit driven by AI that would give independence and autonomy to local governments or other local institutions, to collect data using flexible protocols, able to support planning and policy, generating outputs that are interoperable and comparable.

While global datasets of human populations are rapidly increasing in quality (e.g. Open Building dataset and World Settlement Footprint), they might not work well in certain areas (e.g. people living in tropical forest) and older data is not available.

28,Issue 28,Data,Predicting and mitigating human-animal conflicts,"Human-animal conflicts which contribute to negative and drastic decision-making based on social fears have been one of the major obstacles for wildlife conservation, especially around mammals. Mammals are often registered as protected species or “natural monuments”, however, even these highest social protections could be removed when the incidents of the conflicts are reported repeatedly in the media.

The number of incidents of human-animal conflicts has increased dramatically over the past years (WWF 2021). This is due to the climate and landuse change causing drastic impacts on their habitats and food provisions. For example, there were 8,839 wild bear sighting in residential areas in Japan between April and October 2023, with 5 death and 180 injuries. This is said to be due to the nation wide acorn crop failure due to the unusally hot summer. Warm winter means that wild bears also did not hibernated long enough to rest. The increase of abondoned agricultural lands due to the population declines, and unharvested fruit trees in villages exasibated the situation. 

AI cameras are already in use in different countries to track mammals, and warn communities when they are in vicinity. In the future, combinations of data on environmental and anthropogenic drivers will happen including: climate predictions, food growth predictions, alternative food existence, patterns of animal migrations, locations of past human-animal conflicts, land use change, existence of buffer zones, existence of registered hunters, abandoned farmlands, sighting of animals by citizens.

AI with combined short and long term data sets will provide not only more accurate predictions with less panic in society, as well as opportunities to take measures as early as possible, including planting different types of trees with nuts to become alternative wild food for animals.
